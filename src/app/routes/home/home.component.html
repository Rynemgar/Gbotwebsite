    <p class="para">Gladiator Bot was designed first off with some fun functions to use in chat. For example, typing
      *shoot @user will randomly select one in 6 phrases to respond with. Were you out of arrows, or did you get your
      target right between the legs? OOOH…!

      <br><br>Since he has grown, more and more features have been added. Most recently, the addition of potions for use
      during battle.
      Low on HP, pop a potion and regain 30hp. Gladiator Bot hands out rewards like candy so we needed a way to top his
      coffers back up! Therefore, each potion is purchasable for 150 TRTL.</p>

    <div class="column paracent"><h1 class="head">How Combat Works</h1>
    <p class="para">Built as a turn based battle, fighters take turns to batter their opponent’s life from their body
      using 3 commands.<br>
      *head – has a 10% chance of inflicting 50 damage.<br>
      *body – has a 33% chance of inflicting 30 damage.<br>
      *legs – has an 80% chance of inflicting 10 damage.<br>
      <br>
      Reduce your opponent to 0hp with a combination of strategy and luck!<br>
      But don’t forget your saving grace.<br>
      *potion – recovers 30hp, provided you have purchased your potion! Don't go in without supplies though! Better keep
      track of your *stock</p>
