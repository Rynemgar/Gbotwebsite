    <p class="para">Gladiator Bot was designed first off with some fun functions to use in chat. For example, typing
      *shoot @user will randomly select one in 6 phrases to respond with. Were you out of arrows, or did you get your
      target right between the legs? OOOH…!

      <br><br>Since he has grown, more and more features have been added. Most recently, the addition of potions for use
      during battle.
      Low on HP, pop a potion and regain 30hp. Gladiator Bot hands out rewards like candy so we needed a way to top his
      coffers back up! Therefore, each potion is purchasable for 150 TRTL.</p>

    <p class="para">Built as a turn based battle, fighters take turns to batter their opponent’s life from their body
      using 3 commands.<br>
      *head – has a 10% chance of inflicting 50 damage.<br>
      *body – has a 33% chance of inflicting 30 damage.<br>
      *legs – has an 80% chance of inflicting 10 damage.<br>
      <br>
      Reduce your opponent to 0hp with a combination of strategy and luck!<br>
      But don’t forget your saving grace.<br>
      *potion – recovers 30hp, provided you have purchased your potion!  You also have a 5% chance of a critical heal, healing you for a staggering 100hp! Don't go in without supplies though! Better keep
      track of your *stock</p>

    <h1 class="head">Stats and what they do</h1>
    <p class="para">Stats have been designed to allow player personalisation of their character.  For each level you gain, you can purchase 3 stat points.  You can then spend these stat points on upgrading your strength, defense and agility.<br>
    By upgrading your stats in this way, each battle will become different.<br>
  Of course, this could create issues with higher levels decimating lower levels so in the future, a stop gap will be implemented.<br>
If someone with much higher stats gets into a battle with someone with much lower stats, the stats will be decreased down to a fair advantage.  After all... If you're going to pick on the little people, we may as well give them a chance!</p>

    <h1>How stats can help you</h1>
    <p>Using your stat points is a completely custom choice.  No two gladiators will use the exact same system and that's good!<br>
    If you increase your strength, your attacks will increase by 1 damage.<br>
  This means your opponent has to hope you miss more often.<br>
If you increase your defense, you'll take 0.9 less incoming damage.<br>
This means your opponent has to work that much harder to beat you!<br>
If you increase your agility, you'll increase your chance to hit by 0.1%<br>
That may not sound much, but it adds up... quickly!<br>
This way of adding personalised stats means that battles can vary dramatically.  If one person has maxed their strength and another has maxed their defense, it's back down to luck.  But the mixing of these stats causes for people to really have to think how best to beat each opponent!</p>
