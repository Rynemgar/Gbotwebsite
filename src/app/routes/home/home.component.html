    <p class="para">Gladiator Bot was designed first off with some fun functions to use in chat.  For example, typing *shoot @user will randomly select one in 6 phrases to respond with.  Were you out of arrows, or did you get your target right between the legs? OOOH…!

      <br><br>Since he has grown, more and more features have been added.  Most recently, the addition of potions for use during battle.
      Low on HP, pop a potion and regain 30hp.  Gladiator Bot hands out rewards like candy so we needed a way to top his coffers back up!  Therefore, each potion is purchasable for 150 TRTL.</p></div>
